            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Carlos, a Full Stack Developer based in Madrid, Spain. My programming journey began with a childhood fascination for websites, my dad's teachings for coding and a friend's encouragement convinced me to give it a try as well! a third time's the charm.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love things that involve art, which it's why I've had a connection with the front end and creative programming and solving puzzles, it's in our daily lives such as problem solving on work or reminiscing what you needed to buy when doing groceries... or how to beat the water temple in Ocarina of Time ðŸ˜­.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But what about those things that engage you when doom scrolling? It's also soo intriguing, it's why I'm taking bits of data science and ai engineering to know whats up in our digital world and how it functions!</p>
